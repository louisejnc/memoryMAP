# MONTREAL MAP PROJECT

This project is obviously quite different of the work that I was projecting to do in my written proposal. In fact, I have realized that what was amazing with my student exchange experience was my familiarization with new places, new people and new habits. The idea of routine was missing the main common thing between those three subjects : memories.

I have always accorded a particular importance to memories but during my exchange semester I have decided to almost collect them. My way of 'collecting memories' was by taking videos. According to me, videos is the best way to convey the whole atmosphere of a moment.

With this project I created a place where I could store those memories giving you the possibility to retrace "the story" of my exchange semester. You can navigate through a map of Montreal created from my point of view with a selection of important places, streets, parks, where I have created memories. Red icons displayed over it give you access to the video that I've taken at the location. Cyan icons give you access to particular indoors places detailed maps in which you can access more memories.

Concerning the aesthetic and the presentation of my project, I wanted to keep a certain roughness. As if you were infiltrating a database. No title screen or instructions. Simple lines, dots and square to represent for the map and the icon. Simple colors too which improve the impression of database.

I am satisfied with what I have achieved technically, my code does work and is ready for data storage but I still have to create the maps of three of the indoors places and store more memories.

I tried to make the user navigation as intuitive as possible but I would like to improve it with the possibility of scaling with the mouse wheel. In fact it would certainly be needed at a moment because as I would keep on collecting and storing my video memories in this work the map will grow bigger. Ideally I imagine a world map where I would store all of my video memories. I might display the dates of the videos to facilitate the comprehension of the 'storyline'. I will improve the display of indoors places and the way out of indoors places which is by clicking the right mouse button at the moment.

Good exploration !
